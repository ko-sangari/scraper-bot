# ðŸ¤– Welcome to Scraper Bot
I wrote this bot for myself to find accommodation on **[holland2stay](https://holland2stay.com)** website. \
I'll be happy if it can help improve your experience in searching for your desired accommodation.

## â­• Features
Scraping the website every 2 minutes, check for any available accommodations and sends them to your Telegram account.

## â­• Before you begin
Before you begin, please follow these steps:

### ðŸ’¢ Add `.env` file :

1. Rename the `.env.template` file to `.env`.
2. Update the variables in the `.env` file according to your local environment.


### ðŸ’¢ Setting Up a Telegram Bot :

To use this application, you'll need to create a Telegram bot and obtain its token. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Start a Chat with BotFather**: BotFather is Telegram's official bot for creating and managing other bots. Open your Telegram app and search for `@BotFather`. Start a chat with it.

2. **Create a New Bot**: In the chat with BotFather, send the command `/newbot`. BotFather will ask you for a name and username for your new bot. Follow the prompts and provide the necessary information.

3. **Save Your Bot Token**: After your bot is created, BotFather will provide a token for your bot. This is a unique string that allows you to control your bot via the Telegram API. Copy and save this token securely.

4. **Set the Token in Your Environment**: Place the bot token in the `.env` file. This is usually done by adding a line like `TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_token_here` in the `.env` file.

By following these steps, you'll have a new Telegram bot and its associated token, ready to be used with this application.


### ðŸ’¢ Find the Telegram User ID :
Now, to add Telegram clients, it's essential to acquire their respective Telegram IDs. To do this, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Search for the UserInfo Bot**:
   Open Telegram and search for `@userinfobot`. This bot can provide your user information, including your user ID.

2. **Start the Bot**:
   Click on the bot in the search results to open a chat, then click the "Start" button at the bottom of the chat window.

3. **Get Your ID**:
   The bot will automatically send you a message that includes your user ID and other details. Your Telegram user ID can be found in this message. To use it, add your ID to the `.env` file by inserting a line such as `TELEGRAM_IDS=123456789`.
